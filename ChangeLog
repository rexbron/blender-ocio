Initial Change Log for Blender 2.26 Sun Feb  9 10:53:10 UTC 2003

New features of Blender 2.26:
-----------------------------

- Mousewheel support for all windows. Two user settings are added in the
   top window for mousewheel usage. The zoom direction [WZoom] and the
   number of lines that get scrolled [WLines] can be set here.
   The mousewheel also works to increase/decrease the size of the circle
   while selecting or doing proportional scaling. 

- A "fake user" button next to the material popup has been added, to keep
   the data when it has been unlinked from an object. (Basically a shortcut
   for pressing Shift+F4 and F)

- Added support for manipulating Ipo bezier handles through the action
   window. Selecting action keys and pressing VKEY, HKEY, or shift-HKEY
   modifies the handles of the keys in the same way it does in the IPO
   window.

- CKEY in the action window scrolls the window so that the current frame
   is in the center.

- Extra selection support for the action window, including:
     - border select initiated in the channel names border selects the
       channels and constraint channels.
     - right click or border select initiated in the horizontal scroll
       causes blender to select all keys for the selected frames.
     - right click or border select in the vertical scroll causes blender
       to select all keys for the channel or constraint channels that are
       to the left of the selection.

- X-ray bones support for showing armature bones in shaded mode (disabled
   depth test). The new x-ray button is added in the edit buttons when the
   armature is selected.

- TKEY in the action window changes the Ipo type (constant/linear/bezier)
   for the Ipo curves owned by the selected channels

- Simple shaded+wire and solid+wire drawmodes. It basically draws the
   wireframe after drawing the model in solid/shaded/textured mode.
   The user can set this per object using the "Wire" button in the edit
   buttons window.

- A headerbutton for drawing linenumbers in the texteditor.

- Ctrl keystrokes for cut/copy/paste/undo/redo in the texteditor.

- NTSC render preset (Image size - 720x480, Aspect ratio - 10x11, 30 fps)


Bugfixes:
---------

- Make switching to bottom, back, and left view (shift+pad7, shift+pad1
   and shift+pad1) work when in camera view.

- Full screen by default under Unix.

- Ignore WM_DELETE_WINDOW on IRIX.

- Icons in the imageselect window get drawn properly.


Workarounds:
------------

- A small modification is made that prevents closing the renderwindow on
   Mac OSX, so the GUI won't becoming irresponsive.


Still Not working:
-----------------

Plugins in MacOSX

Older Python API

New build system using configure (this is partially working but
        needs some work)
