Initial Change Log for Blender 2.26 Sun Feb  9 10:53:10 UTC 2003

New features of Blender 2.26:
-----------------------------

- Mouse wheel support for all windows.

- A "fake user" button next to the material pop-up.
   (basically a shortcut for pressing Shift+F4 and F)

- Added support for manipulating Ipo bezier handles through
   the action window. Selecting action keys and pressing VKEY,
   HKEY, or shift-HKEY modifies the handles of the keys in
   the same way it does in the IPO window.

- CKEY in the action window scrolls the window so that the current frame
   is in the center.

- Extra selection support for the action window, including:
     - border select initiated in the channel names border
       selects the channels and constraint channels.
     - right click or border select initiated in the horizontal
       scroll causes blender to select all keys for the selected
       frames.
     - right click or border select in the vertical scroll
       causes blender to select all keys for the channel or
       constraint channels that are to the left of the selection.

- Simple shaded+wire and solid+wire draw modes. It basically draws
   the wire frame after drawing the model in solid/shaded/textured mode.
   The user can set this per object using the "Wire" button in the
   edit buttons window.

- A header button for drawing line numbers in the text editor.

- Ctrl keystrokes for cut/copy/paste/undo/redo in the text editor.

- Support for BMP images.

- NTSC render preset (Image size - 720x480, Aspect ratio - 10x11, 30 fps)

- x-ray bones support for showing armature bones in shaded
   mode (disabled depth test). The new x-ray button is added
   in the edit buttons when the armature is selected.

- TKEY in the action window changes the Ipo type
  (constant/linear/bezier) for the Ipo curves owned by the
   selected channels

- Disabling need for a "Key" to use all the features

- Moved to ode for python physics...
- WM_Hints were also added for window managers that look for that sort of thing,

- a few extra shortcuts added to the space bar menu.
- Plugins work again on most platforms (MacOSX still not working).  

Bug fixes:
---------

- Make switching to bottom, back, and left view (shift+pad7, shift+pad1
   and shift+pad1) work when in camera view.

- Full screen by default under Unix.

- Ignore WM_DELETE_WINDOW on IRIX.

- Icons in the image select window get drawn properly.


Still Not working:
-----------------

Plugins in MacOSX

Older Python API

New build system using configure (this is partially working but
        needs some work)
