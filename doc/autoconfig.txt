A little guide to autoconf/automake

If you want to play with the new autoconf environment you need to do the
following, inside this dir:
./bootstrap
mkdir ../newdir
cd ../newdir
../blender/configure

Take a look at INSTALL for options you can give to configure.

Ok the way things are setup for blender to make changes to the build system
you want to edit Makefile.am's and configure.ac  (configure.ac is the
new name for configure.in)  After that you need to run
./bootstrap to generate configure and the Makefile.in's.
(Makefile.am's are input to automake to generate Makefile.in's
configure.ac and the Makefile.in's are input to autoconf to generate 
a configure script useable by other people.)


I've been using autoconf 2.56 and automake 1.7 so if your using and older
version and are having problems you might try upgrading.

Here is a neat little tree I dug up somewhere on how you would get
started on a system:
your source files --> [autoscan*] --> [configure.scan] --> configure.ac

configure.ac --.
               |   .------> autoconf* -----> configure
[aclocal.m4] --+---+
               |   `-----> [autoheader*] --> [config.h.in]
[acsite.m4] ---'

Makefile.in -------------------------------> Makefile.in


Files used in configuring a software package:

                       .-------------> [config.cache]
configure* ------------+-------------> config.log
                       |
[config.h.in] -.       v            .-> [config.h] -.
               +--> config.status* -+               +--> make*
Makefile.in ---'                    `-> Makefile ---'

TODO:
to finish up the intern dir,

 Square away how ghost works.
(i.e. would be nice if under windows you could choose X11 or normal windows
libs, same with macos.. right now its a cludge and it doesn't do one explicitly
probably involves changing the way configure.ac picks stuff)

Get intern/python figured out.
fix the following in configure.ac
        --with-mozilla=dir      (get it so nspr is autodetected here)
        --with-nspr=dir         (incase in different dir)

Get source/Makefile.am finished.
