/**A file selector can be seen in Blender when you load (F1) or save (F2) a file. For the Python API you want to use the same mechanism to get access to the filename and the path a user can select interactively. You have to activate the FileSelector with a callback function (in Python). When the user has finished his selection the callback function is called and you can access the filename and the path in the callback function.
