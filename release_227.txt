- support for Freetype fonts in 3D Font Object
- redesigned user pref buttons
- Windows & OSX: support for QuickTime image (gif, tiff, psd) and movie (.mov) in/out
- autoskinning for Armatures, when parenting a Mesh to an Armature it gives a menu

Bugfixes:
---------

Check the bug tracker for a complete listing:
http://projects.blender.org/tracker/index.php?group_id=9&atid=125

A shortlist:
- Lattices deform correctly again
- Plugins (textures, sequence effects) in MacOSX now work
- Plugins for Windows work again

Work Arounds:
------------

- OpenGL support for several Linux systems can cause problems when rendering with a 2nd Window.
  Use option F10->DispView instead. This is still being investigated...

Didn't make it:
------------
- advanced shading support (Blinn, cartoon rendering)

Still Not working:
-----------------

- FaceSelect mode in OSX causes bad redrawing of the backbuffer (it flashes)
- The Blender210 Python API. The only API which is available in 2.27 is the one that was used in 2.25
- New build system using configure (this is partially working but needs more work)
- Physics support in the game engine
