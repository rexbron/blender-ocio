New features of Blender 2.27:
-----------------------------

- source code: all Dutch comments have been translated to English
- new & antialised fonts in interface (Freetype)
- translation system for tooltips, buttons and menus, with support for non-latin character sets. 
  Instructions for how to work with this will be at the www.blender.org frontpage.
- 'rename file' (NKEY) option in FileSelect and ImageSelect windows
- 'remove file' (XKEY) option in ImageSelect
- rightmouse menu in Text window, for open/save file.
- Alt-M in TextWindow: copies the text to the active (3d) Font Object in 3D window
- support for Freetype fonts in 3D Font Object
- redesigned user pref buttons
- autoskinning for Armatures, when parenting a Mesh to an Armature it gives a menu
- new (larger) icons for Windows XP
- new draw mode for Lamps in 3D window
- new menu for window-type
- shadowbuffers now can have any size (with number-button)
- Windows & OSX: support for QuickTime image (gif, tiff, psd) and movie (.mov) in/out
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Please note! The selected Quicktime codec does *not* get saved
  in the blendfile. Each time you startup Blender you have to
  reselect the codec from the codec dialog. Background rendering
  displays a codec dialog first when you start a render process.
  --------------------------------------------------------------
- The rendermenu now shows which codec is set for rendering.
- A small button has been added that toggles the visibility of the pulldown menu titles.


Win32 only:
-----------
- Clipboard support to copy/paste text from and to the texteditor.
  Try with alt-shift-c and alt-shift-v.

- A button has been added to the top header which allows runtime
  switching between windowed and fullscreen mode. Commandline
  options -w/-W for these two screenmodes are also available.

- During animation playback, the current framenumber gets displayed
  in the animwindow header.

- (Experimental) A button has been added which allows you to list
  all available codecs in the avi codec dialog, instead of listing
  only certified codecs.


Bugfixes:
---------

Check the bug tracker for a complete listing:
http://projects.blender.org/tracker/index.php?group_id=9&atid=125

A shortlist:
- Lattices deform correctly again
- Plugins (textures, sequence effects) in MacOSX now work
- Plugins for Windows work again

Work Arounds:
------------

- OpenGL support for several Linux systems can cause problems when rendering with a 2nd Window.
  Use option F10->DispView instead. This is still being investigated...

Didn't make it:
------------
- advanced shading support (Blinn, cartoon rendering)

Still Not working:
-----------------

- FaceSelect mode in OSX causes bad redrawing of the backbuffer (it flashes)
- The Blender210 Python API. The only API which is available in 2.27 is the one that was used in 2.25
- New build system using configure (this is partially working but needs more work)
- Physics support in the game engine
